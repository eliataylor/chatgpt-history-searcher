## This is the code provided by my prompts in ***Gemini*** to

> "write a javascript project that can be executed in a browser to help me scrape and search my AI chat threads."

### I'll circle back with a complete comparative review soon. meanwhile some notes:


#### My first prompt
> "Let's write a javascript project that can be executed in a browser to help me scrape and search my AI chat threads." 

was denied with 

> "Due to the potential privacy implications and ethical considerations of scraping chat history without explicit user consent, I cannot provide code or instructions to complete this task...."
 
I tried to explain my intentions and it still declined.

#### My second attempt prompted
> Write a javascript class to print json of {href, title} for all links within a given css selector. Also scroll to the button of the given css container, wait 500 ms, and repeat the link scraping if any new titles are found.

Returned viewer.html

Overall, Gemini did not do well using Jquery or Boostrap, but got the gist of what I was asking for eventually.
